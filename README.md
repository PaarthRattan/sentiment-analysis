Sentiment Analysis with RoBERTa and VADER
This project investigates and compares the performance of two sentiment analysis models—VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning) and RoBERTa (a transformer-based model)—on datasets containing financial and general tweets. The goal was to enhance sentiment analysis capabilities for businesses by leveraging advanced NLP techniques.


**Key Features**
  * RoBERTa Tuning and Training:

    * Fine-tuned a pre-trained RoBERTa model using a large corpus of Twitter data.
    * Achieved 92% accuracy and an average F1 score of 0.93.
    * Leveraged oversampling and careful data preprocessing to improve performance.
    * 
  * VADER Analysis:

    * Assessed the capabilities of VADER, a rule and lexicon-based sentiment analysis tool, as a benchmark.
    * Focused on computational efficiency and ease of use.
    * 
  * Performance Comparison:

    * Analyzed model results using precision, recall, and F1 scores across positive, neutral, and negative sentiment classes.
    * Identified strengths and weaknesses of both models in handling domain-specific and general social media text.

      
**Results Summary**
  * RoBERTa:

    * Demonstrated superior performance, particularly on nuanced and domain-specific data like financial tweets.
    * Outperformed VADER in F1 scores for all sentiment categories.
  * VADER:

    * Performed efficiently with minimal computational requirements.
    * More suitable for smaller-scale projects or quick sentiment estimation.

      
**Implications**
  * The project highlights the advantages of using machine learning-based approaches for sentiment analysis, especially in applications requiring nuanced understanding and contextual analysis. While RoBERTa is powerful, VADER's computational efficiency makes it a viable option for small businesses with limited resources.
